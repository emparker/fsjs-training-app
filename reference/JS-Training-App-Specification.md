## 🎯 Core Concept

A sleek, engaging web app that delivers bite-sized JavaScript/React training through varied question formats. Think Duolingo meets LeetCode, but specifically tailored for becoming an excellent coding instructor. The app generates contextual questions, tracks progress, and teaches both the content AND how to teach it.

## 🤖 Card Generation System

### Hybrid Approach

#### Pre-Generated Question Bank (Stored in MongoDB)
- **Initial Set**: 150-200 curated questions covering:
  - JavaScript fundamentals (variables, scope, closures, async)
  - React essentials (hooks, lifecycle, state, props)
  - MongoDB/Mongoose basics (CRUD, schemas, queries)
  - HTML/CSS key concepts
  - Common debugging scenarios
  - Terminal commands
  - Dev tools usage

#### Claude API Integration (On-Demand Generation)
- **Triggers**:
  - "Give Me a Similar Question" button
  - When pre-generated bank depleted in specific category
  - Advanced mode (always fresh challenges)
- **API Prompts Structure**:
```javascript
const generateQuestionPrompt = (context) => `
You are generating a training question for a JavaScript instructor.

Context:
- User just answered incorrectly about: ${context.topic}
- Difficulty: ${context.difficulty}
- Question Type: ${context.type}

Generate a NEW question that:
1. Tests the same concept differently
2. Includes a code snippet if applicable
3. Has 4 multiple choice options (if MC type)
4. Provides clear explanation
5. Includes a teaching analogy
6. Suggests how to teach this to students

Format as JSON:
{
  "question": "...",
  "codeSnippet": "...",
  "options": ["A. ...", "B. ...", "C. ...", "D. ..."],
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "explanation": "...",
  "analogy": "...",
  "teachingTip": "..."
}
`;
```

#### Fallback Strategy
- If API fails/rate-limited: Use pre-generated questions
- Cache AI responses to reduce API calls
- Store highly-rated AI questions to database for reuse

### Question Selection Algorithm
```javascript
function selectQuestion(mode, userHistory) {
  // 1. Filter by mode difficulty
  // 2. Exclude recently answered (last 50)
  // 3. Prioritize weak topics (if data available)
  // 4. Randomize from filtered pool
  // 5. If pool empty, use AI generation
}
```
